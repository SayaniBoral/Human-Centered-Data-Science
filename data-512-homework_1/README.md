# Monthly Wikipedia article views of famous movies

## Project Goal
This notebook has been used to publish datasets of monthly article traffic for a select set of movies from English Wikipedia from July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2023. It also shows some exploratory analysis in forms of visualizations.


## Source of data
The page view data is sourced using the [Wikimedia REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_API). The API documentation, [pageviews/per-article](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews%20data), covers additional details that may be helpful when trying to use or understand how to retrieve monthly page view per article. The license of the source data and a link to the Wikimedia Foundation REST API terms of use: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/REST_API#Terms_and_conditions

The list of articles represent 1359 Academy award winning movies.
