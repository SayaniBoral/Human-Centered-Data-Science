    "# US EPA Air Quality System API Example\n",
    "This code illustrates how to request data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works systematically through example calls, requesting an API key, using 'list' to get various IDs and parameter values, and using 'daily summary' to get summary data that meets specific condistions. The notebook contains example function definitions that could be reused in other code. In general, the notebook explains each step along the way, referring back to possible output. Some of the explanations are tailored to the specific example requests of the API. Changing values to explore the results of the API is probably useful, but that will result in some explanations being out of sync with the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. This example code provides examples of the county based and bounding box based API calls. Some [additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata) on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this notebook is to get to some values that we might use for the Air Quality Index or AQI for Grand Island, Hall County, Nebraska. You might see this reported on the news, most often around smog, but more frequently with regard to smoke. The AQI index is meant to tell us something about how healthy or clean the air is on any day. The AQI is actually a somewhat complext measure. When I started this example I looked up [how to calculate the AQI](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf) so that I would know roughly what goes into that value.\n",

    "Once you have a key, the next thing is to get information about the different types of air quality monitoring (sensors) and the different places where we might find air quality stations. The monitoring system is complex and changes all the time. The EPA implementation allows an API user to find changes to monitoring sites and sensors by making requests - maybe monthly, or daily. This API approach is probably better than having the EPA publish documentation that may be out of date as soon as it hits a web page. The one problem here is that some of the responses rely on jargon or terms-of-art. That is, one needs to know a bit about the way atmospheric sciece works to understand some of the terms. ...
