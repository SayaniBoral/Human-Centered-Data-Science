#  Wikipedia scoring of article content of all US cities

## Project Goal
This notebook has been used to publish a single dataset of CSV format that helps in analyzing the following:
- The US states with the greatest and least coverage of cities on Wikipedia compared to their population.
- The US states with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about cities.
- A ranking of US geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.


It merges dataset from Wikipedia article about the cities,ORES score of the article, population data of the state and regional division data that the state belongs to.


## Source of data
It merges dataset from Wikipedia article about the cities,ORES score of the article, population data of the state and regional division data that the state belongs to.

## Structure of the repository

- Final_outputs - Contains the final CSV : wp_scored_city_articles_by_state 
- notebooks - Comtains the notebook code
- sources - Contains raw data files which are the data sources
- staging_outputs - Contains any intermediary output files that was staged after transformation step like joining/merging

## Research Implications

__What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?__



__What (potential) sources of bias did you discover in the course of your data processing and analysis?__


__What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?__


__Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?__
